Morphik is a database that makes it easy to create fast, versatile, and production-ready AI apps and agents.

Key features include:

- **First class support for Unstructured Data**: Unlike traditional databases, Morphik allows users to directly ingest unstructured data of all forms - including (but not limited to) videos and PDFs. We've built research-driven custom algorithms to ensure state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.
- **Out of the box MCP support**: Morphik has [built in support](/using-morphik/mcp) for [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - so you can integrate your knowledge with any MCP client in a single click.
- **User and Folder Scoping**: Organize and isolate your data with multi-user and folder-based access controls. Create logical boundaries for different projects or user groups while maintaining a unified database.
- **Completely source-available**: You can check out Morphik core code [here!](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/).
- **Flexible Model Registry**: Easily register and use hundreds of different AI models across your application with our new registered models approach. Mix and match models by task (e.g., use smaller models for simpler tasks, powerful models for complex reasoning) through a simple configuration.
- **Enterprise App Provisioning**: For Teams and Enterprise users, Morphik offers a [Management API](/api-reference/management-api) to provision and manage isolated application environments, each with its own dedicated database.
